Alert She

This is a project created for our submission to HackOnBlocks Hackathon.


â€‹At AlertShe, we believe in the power of connection and community. Our online platform offers a safe space for women in emergency situations to communicate with each other 
and share experiences. We also provide resources for sexual assault victims, empowering them to seek help, connect with others, and heal. Our mission is to help those in 
need and create a supportive network that will encourage growth and recovery.

Our Story
AlertShe was founded by a group of dedicated individuals passionate about women's safety and technology. Inspired by the need for a trustworthy platform where women can report incidents and access safety resources without fear of tampering, we created AlertShe. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to provide a secure space for women to share their experiences and support each other.
