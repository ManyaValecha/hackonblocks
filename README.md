Alert She

This is a project created for our submission to HackOnBlocks Hackathon.


â€‹At AlertShe, we believe in the power of connection and community. Our online platform offers a safe space for women in emergency situations to communicate with each other 
and share experiences. We also provide resources for sexual assault victims, empowering them to seek help, connect with others, and heal. Our mission is to help those in 
need and create a supportive network that will encourage growth and recovery.
